Payhow before you Paynow! Telegram bot aimed to make splitting the bill with friends a whole lot easier

## What does it do and who is it for?
You know when you're out for drinks and everyone pays separate amounts for different items but everybody wants to 
split the bill evenly at the end of the night? Yea, long gone are the days of mental sums and (*slightly impaired*) tissue paper math.

This bot is designed to take separate payment entries and return an even repayment structure in the most efficient
way possible. It is meant to work in telegram groups where bills are usually discussed.
